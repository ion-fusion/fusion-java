  '''
Operations for sexps (_a.k.a._ S-expressions) and pairs.

An _sexp_ is a [sequence][], an ordered [collection][] of values, with zero-based
integer keys and O(_n_) lookup of elements.  Generally, sexps are linked lists
of _pairs_, each of which has a _head_ slot and a _tail_ slot.  In addition to
pairs, there are zero-length sexps --- for example, the result of `(quote ())`
--- and of course `null.sexp`.

A _proper sexp_ is one in which the tail of the final pair is a zero-length
sexp (_not_ `null.sexp`).

At present, pairs and sexps are immutable.  Issue [FUSION-102] covers mutable
sexps.
