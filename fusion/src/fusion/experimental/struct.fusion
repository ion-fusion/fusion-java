  (defpub_j struct_merge1

    (struct_merge1 struct1 struct2)

Functionally merges the mappings of `struct1` and `struct2`, removing repeated
fields. Mappings from `struct2` will replace those from `struct1` with the
same key. If there are repeated fields, one is selected arbitrarily.
The result has the same type as the first argument.

    '''
    (struct_merge1_m struct1 struct2)

Merges the mappings of `struct1` and `struct2`, removing repeated fields and
mutating the first argument when possible. Mappings from `struct2` will
replace those from `struct1` with the same key.  If there are repeated fields,
one is selected arbitrarily. The result has the same type as the first
argument.
