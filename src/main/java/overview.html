FusionJava is the reference implementation of the
<a href="https://ion-fusion.dev/">Fusion programming language</a>, for
Java<sup><font size="-4">TM</font></sup> 8 and above.

<h2>Warnings and Caveats</h2>

<p>
This document describes all classes intended for public consumption, limited to
the packages listed here.  The distribution includes other implementation
classes and packages not documented here;
your use of those packages is not supported, so do us both a favor and
<b>don't use them!</b>
<p>
More generally:
<b>Any behavior or features not present in this API documentation is
unsupported, probably untested, and subject to change without notice.</b>
<p>
Further, do not assume that interfaces and classes documented here may be
implemented or extended by clients of this library; in fact, unless something
is documented as an extension point, you must assume that is <em>not</em> the
case! We may add new methods to interfaces and classes at any time, and your
extensions will probably break when that happens.


<h2>Embedding Fusion</h2>

The primary purpose of these APIs is to enable embedding the Fusion
evaluator into Java applications. The central component for doing so is the
{@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionRuntime}. The runtime is a heavyweight object,
and the vast majority of applications should create exactly one runtime at
launch or on demand. To acquire a runtime, you'll use a
{@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionRuntimeBuilder}.

From the runtime, you can then acquire one or more
{@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.TopLevel}s. Each {@code TopLevel} instace contains
its own namespace in which bindings (that is, variables) can be {@code define}d
and code can be evaluated.

Here's a typical processing sequence:
<pre>
    IonSystem ionSystem = IonSystemBuilder.standard().build();

    FusionRuntime runtime =
        FusionRuntimeBuilder.standard()
            .withRepositoryDirectory(libraryRepository)
            .withRepositoryDirectory(projectRepository)
            .build();

    TopLevel topLevel = runtime.getDefaultTopLevel();
    // The topLevel has the /fusion language already imported.

    // Import our own helper procedures.
    topLevel.requireModule("/com/example/project/helpers");

    // Evaluate an expression.
    Object result = topLevel.eval("(compute_something)");

    // Convert the result to an IonValue.
    IonValue ionResult = runtime.ionize(result, ionSystem);

    // We can also invoke a procedure without making source code.
    result = topLevel.call("our_procedure", 1, "hello");

    // Let's write it as Ion-ish text. Depending on the data, the result
    // may not be readable by an Ion parser.
    FusionIo.write(topLevel, result, System.out);
</pre>


<h2>Concurrency</h2>

Unless documented otherwise, these Java APIs do not provide thread-safety
guarantees, nor does the Fusion language itself. If you need to evaluate
Fusion code from multiple threads, you will need to provide your own
synchronization. In most cases this will involve preventing threads from
simultaneous use of the same {@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.TopLevel}.
<p>
All evaluation APIs such as {@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.TopLevel#eval(String)}
can be cancelled by calling {@link java.lang.Thread#interrupt()} on the
evaluation thread. The evaluator periodically checks the thread interrupt
status, and cancels the computation when it is set. The evaluation API then
throws {@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionInterruptedException}, leaving the
thread interrupt status set. Be aware that some activities, notably reading
from an {@link java.io.InputStream}, are uninterruptible and will block until
control returns to the evaluator.


<h2>Representation of Values</h2>

The data manipulated by the Fusion evaluator are generically referred to as
<em>Fusion values</em>, and this library takes great pain to <em>not</em>
specify or constrain their implementation.  The aim is to allow the evaluator
to be radically rearchitected, rewritten, and/or optimized without disrupting
existing Java applications that embed Fusion.  For instance, implementing a
byte-code compiler for Fusion may require major changes to the concrete
classes that implement the built-in data types.
<p>
<b>The Java classes implementing Fusion values may change at any time.</b>
As a result, the Java APIs used to interact with Fusion values express their
type as {@link java.lang.Object} and you must use the provided APIs to inspect
the values.

<ul>
  <li>
    Do not assume <em>anything</em> about the Java classes or interfaces used
    to implement Fusion values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not assume that two values with the same Fusion type are implemented
    with the same Java type.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use of {@link java.lang.Object#equals} or
    {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode} on Fusion values is not supported.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.Object#toString()} should only be used for debugging;
    the resulting text is not specified by this library and may change at any
    time.
  </li>
</ul>

What this really means is that there's not much you can do directly with an
{@code Object} returned by the Fusion APIs. You must instead use static
utility methods that mirror procedures provided by the Fusion library.
Examples include {@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionValue},
{@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionBool}, and
{@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionIo}.
<p>
Most often you'll want to convert the Fusion value to an
{@link com.amazon.ion.IonValue}, for which you can use
{@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionRuntime#ionize FusionRuntime.ionize()}.

<h2 id="inject">Injection and Ejection</h2>

Because Fusion values may use different representations than the typical Java
classes with similar semantics, this library provides mechanisms for converting
between them.  Converting an application-provided Java value into an equivalent
Fusion values is called <em>injection</em>.  Converting a Fusion value into an
equivalent, well-specified Java value is called <em>ejection</em>.
<p>
In general, you should expect that both injection and ejection result in a
deep copy of the given value. As such, you are advised to limit such
conversions to the bare minimum.  In particular, you should avoid "bouncing"
back and forth between Fusion and Java in a way that causes repeated copying
of large data structures.
<p>
Injection may be lazy. This is intended to reduce the overhead of converting
large Ion containers when only a small portion of the data is needed.  This
library does not specify when and how lazy injection happens, and the process
is not synchronized on any mutex.  As a result, <b>mutation of Java objects
that have been injected into Fusion will result in unspecified behavior</b>.
This applies to all data referenced by the injected object.
<p>
Injection is idempotent: injecting a Fusion value results in the same value.
Unless otherwise specified, APIs that will inject Java objects (for example,
{@link dev.ionfusion.fusion.TopLevel#call TopLevel.call()}) will also
accept Fusion values that were previously injected or that were returned as
a result of evaluating Fusion code.  However, injection involves a potentially
expensive "type switch" and you'll get better performance by avoiding no-op
re-injection of Fusion values.

<h3>Injectable Types</h3>

The following Java types may be injected into the Fusion runtime:
<ul>
  <li>
      Java {@code null} becomes {@linkplain dev.ionfusion.fusion.FusionVoid void},
      which is the equivalent generic "no-value value".
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link com.amazon.ion.IonDatagram} instances are converted to Fusion
    {@code list}s that contain the <em>user values</em> in the datagram.
    System values (version markers and local symbol tables) are not included.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other {@link com.amazon.ion.IonValue} instances are converted to equivalent
    Fusion values, retaining all annotations and precision.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.Boolean} becomes a Fusion {@code bool}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.String} becomes a Fusion {@code string}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.math.BigInteger}, {@link java.lang.Long},
    {@link java.lang.Integer}, {@link java.lang.Short}, and
    {@link java.lang.Byte} become a Fusion {@code int}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.math.BigDecimal} becomes a Fusion {@code decimal}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.Double} becomes a Fusion {@code float}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@code byte[]} becomes a Fusion {@code blob}.
  </li>
</ul>
