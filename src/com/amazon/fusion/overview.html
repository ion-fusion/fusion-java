FusionJava is the reference implementation of the
<a href="https://ion-fusion.dev/">Fusion programming language</a>, for
Java<sup><font size="-4">TM</font></sup> 7 and above.

<h2>Warnings and Caveats</h2>

<p>
This document describes all classes intended for public consumption, limited to
the packages listed here.  The distribution includes other implementation
classes and packages not documented here;
your use of those packages is not supported, so do us both a favor and
<b>don't use them!</b>
<p>
More generally:
<b>Any behavior or features not present in this API documentation is
unsupported, probably untested, and subject to change without notice.</b>
<p>
Further, do not assume that interfaces and classes documented here may be
implemented extended by clients of this library; in fact, unless something is
documented as an extension point, you must assume that is <em>not</em> the
case! We may add new methods to interfaces and classes at any time, and your
extensions will probably break when that happens.


<h2>Representation of Values</h2>

The data manipulated by the Fusion evaluator are generically referred to as
<em>Fusion values</em>, and this library takes great pain to <em>not</em>
specify or constrain their implementation.  The aim is to allow the evaluator
to be radically rearchitected, rewritten, and/or optimized without disrupting
existing Java applications that embed Fusion.  For instance, implementing a
byte-code compiler for Fusion may require major changes to the concrete
classes that implement the built-in data types.
<p>
<b>The Java classes implementing Fusion values may change at any time.</b>
As a result, the Java APIs used to interact with Fusion values express their
type as {@link java.lang.Object} and you must use the provided APIs to inspect
the values.

<ul>
  <li>
    Do not assume <em>anything</em> about the Java classes or interfaces used
    to implement Fusion values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not assume that two values with the same Fusion type are implemented
    with the same Java type.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use of {@link java.lang.Object#equals} or
    {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode} on Fusion values is not supported.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.Object#toString()} should only be used for debugging;
    the resulting text is not specified by this library and may change at any
    time.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="inject"></a>Injection and Ejection</h2>

Because Fusion values may use different representations than the typical Java
classes with similar semantics, this library provides mechanisms for converting
between them.  Converting an application-provided Java value into an equivalent
Fusion values is called <em>injection</em>.  Converting a Fusion value into an
equivalent, well-specified Java value is called <em>ejection</em>.
<p>
In general, you should expect that both injection and ejection result in a
deep copy of the given value. As such, you are advised to limit such
conversions to the bare minimum.  In particular, you should avoid "bouncing"
back and forth between Fusion and Java in a way that causes repeated copying
of large data structures.
<p>
Injection may be lazy. This is intended to reduce the overhead of converting
large Ion containers when only a small portion of the data is needed.  This
library does not specify when and how lazy injection happens, and the process
is not synchronized on any mutex.  As a result, <b>mutation of Java objects
that have been injected into Fusion will result in unspecified behavior</b>.
This applies to all data referenced by the injected object.
<p>
Injection is idempotent: injecting a Fusion value results in the same value.
Unless otherwise specified, APIs that will inject Java objects (for example,
{@link com.amazon.fusion.TopLevel#call TopLevel.call()}) will also
accept Fusion values that were previously injected or that were returned as
a result of evaluating Fusion code.  However, injection involves a potentially
expensive "type switch" and you'll get better performance by avoiding no-op
re-injection of Fusion values.

<h3>Injectable Types</h3>

The following Java types may be injected into the Fusion runtime:
<ul>
  <li>
    Java {@code null} becomes {@linkplain com.amazon.fusion.FusionVoid void},
    which is the equivalent generic "no-value value".
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link com.amazon.ion.IonValue} instances are converted to equivalent
    Fusion values, retaining all annotations and precision.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.Boolean} becomes a Fusion {@code bool}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.String} becomes a Fusion {@code string}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.lang.Integer} and {@link java.math.BigInteger} become a Fusion
    {@code int}.
  </li>
  <li>
    {@link java.math.BigDecimal} becomes a Fusion {@code decimal}.
  </li>
</ul>
