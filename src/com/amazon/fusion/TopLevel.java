/**
 * A top-level namespace for evaluating Fusion scripts or expressions.
 * Each instance has a separate namespace, bootstrapped with bindings from a
 * specific Fusion module or language.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This interface must not be implemented or extended by
 * code outside of this library.
 * <p>
 * {@link TopLevel}s are <em>not</em> inherently thread-safe! It is not safe
 * to use the same instance from multiple threads, unless all such use is
 * functional (that is, no mutations are made) with respect to any common data.
 * Put another way, this library does not perform any synchronization on
 * namespaces or user-visible data structures, so your application must take
 * steps to handle such synchronization when and if it is needed.
 * <p>
 * Using thread-local {@link TopLevel}s is reasonable, if you can properly
 * isolate state changes between requests on the same thread.
 * <p>
 * To create a {@link TopLevel}, use a {@link FusionRuntime}.
 *
 * <h2>Exceptions</h2>
 *
 * Most of the methods on this class are capable of throwing two subclasses of
 * {@link FusionException} that are noteworthy in that applications may
 * require special handling for them:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link ExitException} is thrown if Fusion's {@code exit} procedure
 *     is invoked.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link FusionInterruptedException} is thrown if the evaluation is
 *     cancelled by calling {@link Thread#interrupt()} on the current thread.
 *     When this is thrown the thread's interrupt status will have been set.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
