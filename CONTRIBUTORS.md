## Postscript

The above list was generated by running:
```shell
`git log --pretty=format:"\"%an\""`
```

then unique-ifying the list via:

```ion
(define all_names_chrono
  (reverse (series_to_sexp (in_port))))

(define unique_names_reverse
  (for_fold
    [(names (sexp))]
    [(name all_names_chrono)]
    (if (any (|n| (=== n name)) names)
      names
      (pair name names))))  // Items added to front == reverse chrono

(for [(name (reverse names))]
  (displayln name))
```
