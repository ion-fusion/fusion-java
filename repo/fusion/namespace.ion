(module namespace '/fusion/private/kernel'

  '''
Collections of top-level variables.

A _namespace_ is a set of top-level variables, both name-to-variable bindings
and variable-to-value storage.  Every module has its own namespace holding its
top-level definitions and imported bindings.  Likewise, every script is
evaluated within the context of some namespace.

Namespaces are typically used for [dynamic evaluation](../eval.html).
