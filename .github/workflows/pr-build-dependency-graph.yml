# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
#
# This workflow will build a Java project with Gradle and upload its dependency graph
# for another workflow to download and submit for processing. This split is needed because
# PR-triggered workflows from forked repositories cannot have 'write' permissions.
