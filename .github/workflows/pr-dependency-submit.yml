# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
#
# This workflow will download and submit a dependency graph of a Java project with Gradle
# for another workflow to use to verify dependency safety. This split is needed because
# PR-triggered workflows from forked repositories cannot have 'write' permissions.
#
# See: https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/main/docs/dependency-submission.md#usage-with-pull-requests-from-public-forked-repositories
